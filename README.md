# My Token

This Solidity code is a straightforward example for creating a custom token with basic functionalities like minting and burning. It's designed to help novice Solidity learners grasp the fundamental concepts of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This code represents a basic Solidity contract, which is written in Solidity, a programming language specifically for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes two functions: "mint," used to generate tokens for a particular user, and "burn," which removes tokens from a user who initiates this action.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "Create new file" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the code from [MyToken](MyToken.sol)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "^0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the different functions present in it.
